For example, we may work with an outside company to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b) assist us in distributing emails; (c) assist us with direct marketing and data collection; (d) provide us storage and analysis; (d) provide fraud prevention; and (e) provide other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. We require that these outside companies agree to keep confidential all information we share with them and to use the information only to perform their obligations in our agreements with them.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Other Companies:<\/strong> We may provide information to carefully selected outside companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Business Transitions:<\/strong> We may transfer or share a copy of personal information about you in the event that Venustheme or one of its properties, affiliates, or subsidiaries goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our website prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information, if your personal information will be used contrary to this policy. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Venustheme to transfer all or part of its business and\/or assets to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever.<\/p>\r\n<p>Luma specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its websites to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Compliance with Law:<\/strong> We may provide access to information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website, to limit our legal liability, and to protect our rights or to protect the rights, property, or safety of visitors of this website or the public.<\/p>\r\n<p>Luma partners with advertising companies to place our advertising on publisher websites on the Internet. These advertising companies collect anonymous information about your visits to our web site. This technology involves the use of third party cookies that allow them to develop personalized advertising so that it directly relates to offers that may be of interest to you.

We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us time to carry out your request.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"privacy-policy-title-8\">Your California Privacy Rights<\/h2>\r\n<p>Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes.

Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.<\/p>\r\n<p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used.
